Open-source X.org graphics driver for ARM graphics

DRM driver selection
--------------------
While most operations use only the standard DRM modesetting interfaces, certain operations
unavoidably rely on specific driver behaviour (including dumb buffer allocation flags and cursor
plane z-ordering). As such, the armsoc driver must be configured for a particular DRM driver.

The currently supported DRM drivers are:
- pl111
- exynos

To configure armsoc for one of these, pass the --with-drmmode option to ./configure. For example:

$ ./configure --with-drmmode=pl111

For other drivers, you will need to implement this support yourself. A template implementation is
provided in src/drmmode_template which can be built by passing --with-drmmode=template to ./configure.
The interface is defined and documented in src/drmmode_driver.h, and you should refer to this while
modifying the template to set up your DRM driver's abstraction appropriately.

You can also copy src/drmmode_template into src/drmmode_<yourdrivername> and build with:

$ ./configure --with-drmmode=<yourdrivername>
